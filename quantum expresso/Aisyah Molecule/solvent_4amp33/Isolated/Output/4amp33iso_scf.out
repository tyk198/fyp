     Parallel version (MPI), running on   120 processors

     MPI processes distributed on     1 nodes
     453917 MiB available memory on the printing compute node when the environment starts

     Reading input from 4amp33iso_scf.in

     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  4

     Reading input from environ.in:
     * using full solvent mode
     * setting boundary derivatives method to SCCS default
