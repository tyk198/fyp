[supercomputer:10576] mca_base_component_repository_open: unable to open mca_btl_openib: librdmacm.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory (ignored)

WARNING: Linux kernel CMA support was requested via the
btl_vader_single_copy_mechanism MCA variable, but CMA support is
not available due to restrictive ptrace settings.

The vader shared memory BTL will fall back on another single-copy
mechanism if one is available. This may result in lower performance.
