     Estimating the RAM requirements:
          For the basis sets:      104934.38     M

     Do make sure that you have enough RAM.

     poor_of_ram2 is set to .false.. This means that you would like to increase the speed 
     by storing the D_basis and C_basis vectors which will cause three time of the memory cost.
     Switch it to .true. if you need to save memory.

     p_nbnd_virt is larger than the total number of computed empty states!
     Reset: p_nbnd_virt = all computed empty states!

     Initial vectors are forced to be chosen randomly because no enough particle-hole pairs are available.
     You may want to try to calculate more virtual states or include more occupied states by changing  p_nbnd_occ in the input.

     Finished allocating parameters.
